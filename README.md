## 🐣 My journey
I’m currently a student at **ChasAcademy**, in the midst of my journey to becoming a **fullstack developer**, and I’m absolutely hyped to master coding and bring ideas to life!  

With over a decade of experience in **retail**, I’ve developed a strong understanding of **human behavior** and gained extensive knowledge in **usability** and **customer interaction**.  

I’m naturally curious — always wanting to understand *how* and *why* things work.  
I love optimizing and solving problems, so transitioning into tech felt like the most natural step for me. 🚀
