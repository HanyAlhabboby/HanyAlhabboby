## 🐣 My journey

I recently graduated as a .NET developer, and with a background in warehouse operations, tourism, and media technology, I’ve gained a broad understanding of both people and technology.

These experiences have given me a strong sense of structure, problem-solving, and communication, while also sparking my curiosity about how technology can simplify and improve everyday life.

I thrive in environments where I can analyze, create, and optimize — whether it’s writing clean code, improving user experiences, or collaborating in a team to find the best solutions.
